# Simple AWS S3
Provides the simple way to work with AWS S3. This package is developing while
waiting the supported from aws-sdk from Amazon.

Currently, aws-sdk are not ready for s3 (because they need to support many services).
I hope this crate can help you to the easy way to work with s3 in this time.
